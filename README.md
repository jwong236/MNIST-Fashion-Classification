# MNIST Fashion Classification

This project aims to classify the MNIST Fashion dataset using various machine learning techniques, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.

## Overview

The program utilizes an abstract class to implement different classifier models, with the goal of accurately classifying MNIST-fashion data. The architecture of the program is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, emphasizing low coupling, high cohesion, and code reuse.

The machine learning pipeline consists of the following steps, each handled within specific classes, allowing easy extension with new classifier models:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Initialization
3. Training
4. Validation
5. Testing
6. Evaluation
